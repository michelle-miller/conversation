## Labeling and deleting data in {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
{: #gdpr-wa}

Do not add personal data to the training data (entities and intents, including user examples) that you create.

**Note:** Experimental and beta features are not intended for use with a production environment and therefore are not guaranteed to function as expected when labeling and deleting data. Experimental and beta features should not be used when implementing a solution that requires the labeling and deletion of data.

If you need to remove a customer's message data from a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance, you can do so based on the customer ID of the client, as long as you associate the message with a customer ID when the message is sent to the service.

**Note:** The automatic Slack and Facebook integration features do not support the labeling and therefore deletion of data based on customer ID. These features should not be used in a solution that requires the ability to delete based on customer ID.

### Before you begin
To be able to delete message data associated with a specific user, you must first associate all messages with a unique **customer ID** for each user. To specify the **customer ID** for any messages sent using the `/message` API, include the `X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id` property in your header. For example:

```
curl -X POST -u "apikey:3Df... ...Y7Pc9"
 --header
   'Content-Type: application/json'
   'X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id=abc'
 --data
   '{"input":{"text":"hello"}}'
   'https://gateway-eu-de.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/message?version=2018-09-20'
```
{: codeblock}

**Note**: The `customer_id` string cannot include the semicolon (`;`) or equal sign (`=`) characters. You are responsible for ensuring that each `customer ID` property is unique across your customers.

You can pass multiple **customer ID** values with semicolon-separated `customer_id={value}` pairs. For example: `'X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id=abc;customer_id=xyz'`

### Querying user data
{: #query_customer_id}

Use the `/logs` API `filter` parameter to search an application log for specific user data. For example, to search for data specific to a `customer_id` that matches `my_best_customer`, the query might be:

``` curl
curl -X GET
 --user {username}:{password}
'https://gateway.watson.net/assistant/api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/logs?version=2018-05-26&filter=customer_id::my_best_customer'
```
{: codeblock}

See the [Filter query reference](filter-reference.html) for additional details.

### Deleting data
To delete any message log data associated with a specific user that the service might have stored, use the `DELETE /user_data` API endpoint. Specify the customer ID of the user by passing a `customer_id` parameter with the request.

Only data that was added by using the `POST /message` API endpoint with an associated customer ID can be deleted using this delete method. Data that was added by other methods cannot be deleted based on customer ID. For example, entities and intents that were added from customer conversations, cannot be deleted in this way. Personal Data is not supported for those methods.

**IMPORTANT**: Specifying a `customer_id` will delete *all* messages with that `customer_id` that were received before the delete request, across your entire {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance, not just within one workspace.

As an example, to delete any message data associated with a user that has the customer ID `abc` from your {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance, send the following cURL command:

```
curl -X DELETE
 --user {username}:{password}
 'https://gateway.watson.net/assistant/api/v1/user_data?customer_id=abc&version=2017-05-26'
```
{: codeblock}

An empty JSON object `{}` is returned.

For more information, see the [API reference](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/assistant/api/v1/curl.html?curl#delete-user-data).

**Note:** Delete requests are processed in batches and may take up to 24 hours to complete.
