# Deployment overview

After you have configured your workspace and built a working dialog, you can deploy your application by connecting the workspace to the interface your customers will use. You can also connect your workspace to other services (including other {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services).

This version of the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} documentation is deprecated. Go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-integration-add) instead.

There are various ways you can do this.

- [**Deploying to a channel with the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} connector**](conversation-connector.html): You can use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} connector to deploy a chat bot to Slack or Facebook Messenger, using your workspace and your own Slack or Facebook app.

- [**Building a client application**](develop-app.html): You can use the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} SDK for the language of your choice to develop your own application front end. Your application can then use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} APIs to communicate with the service, while also integrating with third-party services and your own business systems.

- [**Building a bot with Botkit**](integrations.html): You can use the Botkit framework to integrate your workspace with social media and messaging channels.
